    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store Excel files and their row data in a user-specific hierarchy. Each user has their own collection of Excel files, and each Excel file contains a subcollection of rows. This structure ensures data isolation and simplifies security rules based on user ownership. The structure uses path-based ownership for ExcelFile and ExcelRow, ensuring clear ownership semantics and enabling straightforward security rules. This inherently provides authorization independence; no `get()` calls are needed to check user ownership. The structure also supports QAPs because listing operations are scoped to the user's files and rows, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data."
